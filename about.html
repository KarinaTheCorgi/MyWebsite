                    <p class="description">Hello! My name is Karina. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at 
                                           Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I am set to graduate in May 2026, so I'm curently getting all 
                                           my projects together, including this one. </p>
                    <p class="description">I was initially accepted at ERAU intending to pursue a career in Mechanical Engineering, but decided 
                                           that my skillsets more closely aligned with Software Engineering. In 8th grade, I was first introduced 
                                           to the idea of computer science, by taking an elective that taught python. There is no better feeling 
                                           than being in a classroom and just fully understanding the content being taught. At the time I thought, 
                                           this is how most people feel in all there classes, so I didn't think it was that special. I applied to
                                           be a mechanical engineering major because I when I came to visit the University before applying I had 
                                           seen a robotic arm on display that some of the students had created, and I thought "I wanna do <em>that</em>".
                                           Up to that point I had been really into STEM, English was not my strong suit. I hated the readings, 
                                           and the essays, and the discussions. So, I picked the furthest thing from that I could think of. I 
                                           thought that I could possibly be into the idea of creating medical devices. I especially liked the 
                                           idea of being involved in the creation of mechatronic appendages, like robotic arms for amputees.
